# Gruppe-11
1. Semesterprojekt

This is a university project and we have no intention of distributing it in any way. We have used and redrawn some copyrighted characters, mostly Red from Pokemon.
This is a game based on the World of Zuul framework.
The idea is a game set on a space station, where the player is trapped with a few friendly NPCs along with one hostile NPC.
The hostile NPC, the monster, moves throughout the spacestation at the same pace as the player. We're using an initiative system, which means each action adds a set amount to the characters initiative and the character with the lowest initiative moves next. This means that it's possible for the monster or the player to get two turns in a row. The idea currently is for the current weight of the players inventory to add to the initiative "cost" of all actions.
The game has 9 rooms currently, not counting the escape pod, which is a win-condition.
There are also smaller rooms between the rooms, counting as hallways. This puts us way above the 12 room recommendation, but the hallways dont have anything interactive in them.
You start the game in the computer room of the spacestation, with the monster starting in the dorm room.
